# Final Project
### Agricultural and Food Systems 5050 Unit 3

To complete this high-throughput computing task the user should be familiar with the following: command-line, regular expressions, command-line data wrangling, Bash coding and Nextflow.

### Programs used:
Bash
Java
Nextflow - Bioinformatics workflow manager 
SLURM - cluster management and job scheduling system
Blast - Algorithm & program for comparing primary biological sequence information

## Step1. Download all of the files in this respository.

## Step 2. Nextflow config file
A Nextflow configuration file is a simple text file containing a set of parameters and directives. We will utilize the nextflow.config file to launch jobs on the executor (Slurm) so that we don't have to specifiy in our script. 

## Step 3. Bash run script

This script will start our project.
